# Dot File Helper
This is a small set of utilities that I use to help me manage my [desktop](https://github.com/ircurry/cfg).
I ONLY guaruntee that it will work on MY configuration, since that is what it was made to work with.
If you are able to find some utility from any of these programs, more power to you.
